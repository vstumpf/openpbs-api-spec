# OpenAPI spec for OpenPBS

This is an initial, still in-progress api design for [openpbs](https://github.com/openpbs/openpbs)

### Rendering

If you want to render the spec, use [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or Swagger's [online editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)

If you use vscode, I use an extension called [Swagger Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arjun.swagger-viewer)
